genesis-imdb-watchlist
======================

Stream movies from your public IMDB watchlist via XBMC Genesis plugin.

Installation
============

Download this repository as a .zip file. Delete all files except the `video.plugin.genesis-imdb-watchlist` directory from the root directory. Then either install via XBMC [in the usual way](http://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_an_Add-on_from_a_zip_file), or drag the `video.plugin.genesis-imdb-watchlist` folder to your XBMC addons directory (which is one folder up of your [userdata folder](http://kodi.wiki/view/Userdata)).

You need to have [plugin.video.genesis](http://addons.tvaddons.ag/show/plugin.video.genesis/) installed before you can use this plugin.

Setting up
==========

Go to settings first and enter the RSS feed URL of your public IMDB watchlist. You can find the URL by going to [imdb.com](http://www.imdb.com) and clicking "watchlist" in the top menu (you need to be logged in). 
Slightly above the bottom of the screen you'll find an RSS icon next to a link "Export this list". Click the RSS icon, and copy that URL in the settings of this plugin.

This plugin has only been tested on Windows 7, XBMC Gotham 13.2 and plugin.video.genesis v2.2.2.

Enjoy!

TODO
====

* Make this testable (i.e. seperate XBMC specific routines from the rest)
* Add fanart, movie info etc.

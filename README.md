genesis-imdb-watchlist
======================

Stream movies from your public IMDB watchlist via XBMC Genesis plugin.

Installation
============

[Download the zip file of the latest release](https://github.com/LaundroMat/genesis-imdb-watchlist/releases) and install it via XBMC [in the usual way](http://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_an_Add-on_from_a_zip_file).

You need to have [plugin.video.genesis](http://addons.tvaddons.ag/show/plugin.video.genesis/) installed before you can use this plugin.

Setting up
==========

Go to settings first and enter the RSS feed URL of your public IMDB watchlist. You can find the URL by going to [imdb.com](http://www.imdb.com) and clicking "watchlist" in the top menu (you need to be logged in). 
Slightly above the bottom of the screen you'll find an RSS icon next to a link "Export this list". Click the RSS icon, and copy that URL in the settings of this plugin.

This plugin has only been tested on Windows 7, XBMC Gotham 13.2 and plugin.video.genesis v2.2.2.

Enjoy!

TODO
====

* Make this testable (i.e. seperate XBMC specific routines from the rest)
* Add fanart, movie info etc.
